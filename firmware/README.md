# firmware/

Per-chip example projects for `rusty_rtos_port`. Each directory here is a **separate
cargo project**, excluded from the workspace, because every chip needs its own
target triple, linker script and (for Xtensa parts) its own toolchain. n0's
iroh-on-ESP32 work and the Janus family both reached the same conclusion: keep
the firmware projects out of the library workspace so architecture-specific
patches never leak into it.

Naming: `<board>-<demo>/`, for example `lm3s6965-qemu-flash/` or
`esp32c6-devkitc-blink/`.

One cell here has no board: `host-kernel/` runs on the machine you are reading
this on, through `rusty_rtos_port-host`. It is kept beside the others because
it is the same kind of thing — one project, one port, one claim — and because
it is the M3 scheduling cell's experiment moved off the chip, so the two are
meant to be read together.

| Chip class | Runtime | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Cortex-M3 (QEMU `lm3s6965evb`) | `cortex-m-rt` + `rusty_rtos_port-cortex-m` | `thumbv7m-none-eabi` |
| Cortex-M4F / M7 | same | `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` |
| Cortex-M33 | same | `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf` |
| RISC-V RV32 (QEMU `virt`) | `riscv-rt` + `rusty_rtos_port-riscv` | `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` |
| ESP32-C6 / P4 | `esp-hal` + `rusty_rtos_port-riscv` | `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf` / `riscv32imafc-unknown-none-elf` |
| ESP32 / ESP32-S3 | `esp-hal` (esp toolchain) + `rusty_rtos_port-xtensa` | `xtensa-esp32-none-elf` / `xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf` |

Rules:

- Depend on this repo's crates by **path** (`../../crates/rusty_rtos_port`) inside a
  firmware example; depend on siblings by git URL as usual.
- Release profile for a chip: `opt-level = "s"` (or `"z"`), `lto = true`,
  `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, `overflow-checks = true`.
- A firmware example is not a test. The library's tests run on the host and
  on the sim port.
