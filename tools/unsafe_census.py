"""The unsafe census: every fence in the source is in UNSAFE.md.

Hardening gate H-22 (static analysis beyond the default linter), and the
"unsafe census is a release gate" clause of the mission plan's security
doctrine. Two halves, one rule each:

1. The COMPILER guarantees every `unsafe` is fenced: the workspace denies
   `unsafe_code`, so an `unsafe` block, fn or impl compiles only inside an
   item or statement carrying `#[expect(unsafe_code, reason = "...")]`.
2. THIS script guarantees every fence is inventoried: the function (or
   other item) each fence belongs to must be named, in backticks, in
   UNSAFE.md. A new fence nobody wrote up fails CI, so the inventory cannot
   drift from the code.

A fence on an item belongs to that item; a fence on a statement (an
`unsafe` block inside a function) belongs to the enclosing function. A
crate whose lib.rs says `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` must have no fences at
all. Stdlib only, so CI needs nothing but Python.
